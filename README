BPF atomics notes
============

- Currently using bizarro names for the [cmp]xchg ops (`BPF_XCHG = BPF_SET | BPF_FETCH`), need to see what maintainers think of that.

- ADD support appears to work, with x86 jit.

- [cmp]xchg is missing verifier support - need to tell the verifier about the registers being used (e.g. it doesn't currently update R0 as live after BPF_CMPSET | BPF_FETCH).

- Need to figure out if cmpxchg should load the value back into src or R0. Former would mean simpler verifier but need to see how it would bt JITed.
